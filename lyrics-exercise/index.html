		<i>Oh yeah</i>
		<br />
		<i>Come on </i>
		</p> 
		<h4 id="song-parts" class="script"><i>verse 1</i></h4>
		Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
		<br /> Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
		<br /> It's really you, but no one ever discovers
		<br /> In some ways you're just like all your friends
		<br /> <b>But on stage you're a star </b>
		</p> 
		<h4 id="song-parts" class="script"><i>chorus</i></h4>
		</p> 
		You get the best of both worlds
		<br /> Chill it out, take it slow
		<br /> <b> Then you rock out the show </b>
		<br /> You get the best of both worlds 
		<br /> Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds
		<br /> The best of both worlds
		</p> 
		<h4 id="song-parts" class="script"><i>verse 2</i></h4>
		</p> 
		You go to movie premiers <i>(is that Orlando Bloom?)</i>
		<br /> Hear your songs on the radio
		<br /> Livin' two lives is a little weird
		<br /> But school's cool cause nobody knows
		<br /> Yeah you get to be a small town girl
		<br /> But big time when you play your guitar
		</p> 
		<h4 id="song-parts" class="script"><i>chorus</i></h4>
		</p> 
		You get the best of both worlds
		<br /> Chill it out, take it slow, Then you rock out the show
		<br /> You get the best of both worlds
		<br /> Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both
		<br /> You know the best of both worlds
		</p> <h4 id="song-parts" class="script"><i>verse 4</i></h4>
		</p> Pictures and autographs
		<br /> You get your face in all the magazines
		<br /> The best part is that you get to be who ever you wanna be
		</p> <i>(Best! Best!)</i><b> Yeah, the best of both!</b>
		<br /> <i>(Best! Best!)</i><b> You got the best of both!</b>
		<br /> <i>(Best! Best!)</i><b> Come on, the best of both!</b>
		<br /> Who would of thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar
		</p> <h4 id="song-parts" class="script"><i>final chorus</i></h4>
		</p> You get the best of both worlds
		<br /> Chill it out, take it slow
		<br /> Then you rock out the show
		<br /> You get the best of both worlds
		<br /> Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds
		</p> You get the best of both worlds
		<br />Without the shades and the hair
		<br /> You can go anywhere
		</p> You get the best of both <b>girls</b>
		<br />Mix it all together
		<br /><i>Oh, yeah</i>
		<br /> It's so much better 
		<br />'cause you know you've got the best of both worlds
